# TwiceBot

A Discord bot made for Twice fans.

How to use:
- It is hosted, you just have to invite it on your server with this link: [Discord authorization link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=717832695882711143&scope=bot&permissions=70642753).
- The prefix is `twice!` and command arguments are delimited by spaces.
- In the help page: `command <argument/nothing>` means that the arguments are optional.

You can **help me** by **inviting the bot on your server**. If you have ideas for **new commands**, **open an issue** and **detail the command** *its use, an example, (a possible way to do this?)*.

## Available commands
- `group`: Displays information about Twice. Some of the information comes from Spotify.
- `search <music>`: Displays information about the specified music. The information comes from Spotify.
- `links`: Displays links to different Twice accounts on social networks.

‚ö†Ô∏è If **any of the information is false**, please **open an issue** with: 
- The **command** where there is the false information, the **false information** AND the **correct information**.

‚ûï Else if you want to **add more information**, **open an issue** with the **command** where you want to add something, the **section** and **what you want to add**.


üòÖ **I'm not English**, so if you see any **translation errors**, let me know (My current Discord tag is at the bottom of the "links" and "member" commands).

üêå Some commands may be **slow to display**. My **connection is not very good** and the **APIs are sometimes overloaded**.
